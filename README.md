# Arduino PID Flight Controler
This code is a PID controller for flying an Adafruit Feather controlled drone. 

It seems natural that the Feather should fly, but I couldn't find anyone else who has done this, so I did.

This is hard becase the feather that this is designed for only has a 8mhz clock speed and needs to stop for a little bit each time it loops through the listen for Bluetooth.

Good luck on your drone projects and feel free to contact me at zekemedley at gmail dot com if you'd like some guidance. Tuning the PID can be really troublesome.
